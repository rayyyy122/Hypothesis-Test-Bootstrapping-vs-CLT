    "### Basic Information\n",
    "\n",
    "As the demand of fast speed travel, taking plane becomes one of the most popular choice during the past several decades. At the same time, flight delay is most depressing but also sometimes not avoidable. For instance, among different airlines about 0% to 34% was delayed today (FlightAware, 2023).Therefore, the average delay rate of an airline has become a essential standard for customers to evaluate and choose a company. In this project, we will use the dataset that created by Ulrik Thyge Pedersen (2023) to find if there's a significant difference of the delay rate between two industry giants, Delta Airlines and American Airlines.\n",

    "In this project, we plan to use two different methods to conduct a hypothesis test about Discrepancy between the proportion of delayed flights operated by Delta Airlines and Amenrican Airline. First we will use bootstarpping method in the infer package and then we plan to use theory based approach to perform a hypothesis test. We will also construct confidence intervels for the difference between two proportions. We plan to conduct the hypothesis test at the most common significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. In the bootstraping approach, we will use permutation for the null model. For the theorem based one, we will use Central Limit Theorem two sample z test.  \n",
